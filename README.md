# Machine-Learning-Adventures


The Artificial Neural Network:

Using tutorials i have learnt to make an ANN that helps me predict if a particular user is likely stop using the bank's service or not, using the biodata of the uses,full documentation of the code is provides,each essential function has been annotated within the python file.


The Restricted Boltzmann Machine:

Using the RBM modelling techniques I have learnt how to implement the RBM algorithms to apply collabrative filtering onto data sets to help predict movie prefrences:
  Basically we are doing the same thing amazon does when they say People who purchased item X also purchased item Y.
  We basically leverage on the principles of the RBM model to teach our model relationships between Users and the ratings
  they gave movies that they watched, on a scale of 1 to 5. And then we use the same model to predict if said User will or 
  will not like a movie that we reccomend to them. We use datasets that i have downloaded from the internet,better
  better documentation is given in the python files
  
The AutoEncoder:
  The autoencoder unlike the RBM is directed so it uses different fundamentals from the RBM and in this case we also use it to
  help predict ratings that a User would give a movie based off of
